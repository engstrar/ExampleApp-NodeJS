This is an example WebApp that I use when starting most of my projects. It contains different common formats and templates for me to use.

Future Development Goals:

## Installing and Running Locally

Please follow the below steps to set up and run my example app locally:

_Note: these instructions are intended for use on MacOS, other operating systems may differ_

1. Clone files from GitHub:

```
git clone https://github.com/engstrar/ExampleApp-NodeJS.git
```

2. Install all necessary node modules:

```
